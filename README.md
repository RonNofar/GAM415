# GAM415 - Mirror
Note that this repo will be migrating to one that reflects the current project status. This project was created before GAM415, was adapted to the class project, and is now in continued development after GAM415 is over and so no longer has any affiliation with the class.

## What is this?
This project is the embodiment of experimental game mechanics, mostly non-euclidean, and the attempt to design a game that teaches the player these non-traditional mechanics.

## Updates
The recent mechanic added to the project is demonstated in the following demo video:

The game is currently being redesigned to center around this mechanic.

## Other interesting mechanics
The base of the game is built on a 3D world wrapping mechanic where the player can infinitely walk in any direction and always end up in the same place seemlessly. A brief demonstration of this is shown in the following *dated* walkthrough:
